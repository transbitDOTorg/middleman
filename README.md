# Middleman : Easy, Intuitive International Arbitrage
The opportunities are all around.  With a new, global economy in which physical commodities and international trade are both essential and confusing, isn't it time to connect consumers with manufacturers?

Meet Middleman, a project by transbit.org.  Middleman aims to eventually provide a simple interface capable of exporting arbitrage data to Excel, comparing direct-from-manufacturer prices on Alibaba to prices on any market of your choice.  Write your own modules, and create your own market.

Middleman is currently in early alpha testing, and is constantly being improved.  The interface now is nowhere near final.  Feel free to join us on IRC (##transbit @ freenode) to discuss the future of this project.
